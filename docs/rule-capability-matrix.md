# Rule Capability Matrix

This document is the rule capability source of truth for `hongxunpan/validator`. It explains whether each rule is currently supported, planned, adapter-owned, rejected, or still under evaluation.

README should only link to this document. Rule capabilities, statuses, and planning batches should be read from this document and the corresponding version tag.

For quick lookup, read the `Reason / notes` column as the one-line rule description. README only keeps a grouped overview to avoid duplicating this source of truth.

## 1. Status Marks

| Mark | Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | Supported | Implemented in the current core and expected to have tests |
| 🟡 | Planned | Included in the rule roadmap and expected to enter core |
| 🔵 | Adapter | Valid need, but should be implemented by framework / project adapters, not the low-dependency core |
| ⛔ | Rejected | Conflicts with package boundaries and is not expected to be accepted |
| ⚪ | To evaluate | No commitment yet; waiting for real use cases or issues |

## 2. Columns

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Emoji plus text for quick scanning and text search |
| Rule | Canonical rule key; migration aliases are not primary keys in this matrix |
| Category | presence / missing-value / normalization / guard / transform / assertion / cross-field / adapter |
| Argument | DSL argument format; `none` means no argument |
| Mutates value | Whether a successful rule changes output in `validatedData()` |
| Reads dependency | Whether it reads another field's prepared value |
| Missing behavior | Default behavior when the current field is missing |
| Batch | Supported / P0 / P1 / P2 / Adapter / Rejected / To evaluate |
| Reason / notes | Planning reason, boundary, or migration note |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🔵 Adapter | `unique` | adapter | table / field / conditions | no | maybe | adapter-defined | Adapter | Depends on ORM / DB / soft-delete policy; not low-dependency core |

## 7. Maintenance Rules

1. When adding a core rule, update both Chinese and English matrix documents.
2. When a rule moves from 🟡 Planned to ✅ Supported, add tests and canonical examples; do not only change status.
3. When a rule is marked 🔵 Adapter or ⛔ Rejected, keep the reason to avoid repeated debates.
4. README should only link to the matrix, not copy the full table.
5. If the matrix conflicts with code, the current version's code and tests win; fix the documentation immediately.
